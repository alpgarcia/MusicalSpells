### Keyboard Controls
- Use C, D, E, F, G, A, B keys for quick note input

- Try playing without the reference note for higher scores

Remember: Musical skill improves with practice. Don't get discouraged if you find longer sequences challenging at first - keep practicing and you'll become a master musical wizard!
