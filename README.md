# Musical Spells - The Wizards' Duel

[ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ VersiÃ³n en espaÃ±ol](README.es.md)

## Description

Musical Spells is a musical memory and reflex game where you play as a wizard apprentice who must face other sorcerers in musical duels. To defeat your rivals, you must correctly repeat the musical note sequences you hear when your opponent casts their spell.

This game combines elements of musical memory, tone recognition, and quick reflexes, all wrapped in a magical and fun theme.

## Features

- **Turn-based duel system**: Listen and repeat the note sequence to attack your opponent.
- **Multiple difficulty levels**: From Novice (2 notes) to Master (7 notes).
- **Four rival wizards**: Each with a progressive difficulty level.
- **Progress map**: View your advancement and the wizards you've defeated.
- **Complete musical scale**: Play with all seven musical notes (C, D, E, F, G, A, B).
- **Dual controls**: Play using on-screen buttons or keyboard with American notation.
- **Reference note**: Option to hear a C reference note before each duel.
- **Energy system**: Each successful spell reduces your opponent's energy. The first to run out of energy loses.
- **Multi-language support**: Available in English and Spanish, with possibility to add more languages.

## Rival Wizards

1. **Melodic Apprentice** - Level 1
   - The first rival, perfect for practicing your basic skills.

2. **Octave Sorcerer** - Level 2
   - A more experienced wizard who tests your musical memory.

3. **Harmonic Mage** - Level 3
   - An expert sorceress who uses complex musical sequences.

4. **Symphonic Archmage** - Level 4
   - The most powerful wizard, with the longest and most difficult sequences.

## Scoring System

The game features a dynamic scoring system that takes into account several factors:

- **Base points**: 1000 points for each completed level
- **Health bonus**: 10 additional points for each remaining health point
- **Difficulty multipliers**:
  - Novice: x1
  - Apprentice: x1.5
  - Adept: x2
  - Master: x3
- **Reference modifier**: If you play with the reference note enabled, a 0.8 multiplier is applied to the final score

Scores are saved to the Hall of Fame in two cases:
1. Upon completing all levels and defeating the Symphonic Archmage
2. Upon being defeated, but only if you've scored more than 0 points and your score is high enough to enter the top 10

During the game, you can see your current score on the progress map, allowing you to decide if you want to repeat previous duels to improve your score before facing more powerful wizards.
